    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/83/10/27/8310272150b3f68855075c08319b5fde.jpg" alt="sneakers wallpaper">
    <p>I picked the image above because I thought it looked cool. It has a bunch of Nike and Jordan sneakers. 
        My dream job used to be a <em>video game developer</em> but they typically aren't treated or paid well.
        I rather have a career where I can be financially free. One of my favorite foods is <strong>pizza</strong>.
        Pizza can be very addicting.</p>
