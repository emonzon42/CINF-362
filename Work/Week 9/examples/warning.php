Please open the "examples" folder from this week's "CINF362-Week-9-Lecture-Notes.zip" folder to view the code in the examples provided. To have the page work on your local machine, you'd need to install a local web server with PHP on it. 000webhost has PHP already installed so just take all files found in that folder and place them on there as an alternative to doing that. After clicking submit, the page may refresh...that's okay. Just scroll down and you'll see the expected output.</p>
