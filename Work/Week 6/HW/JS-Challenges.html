        <h1>JavaScript Challenges</h1>
        <p>Complete the JS Challenges mentioned in this week's lecture notes. You will have to create forms using HTML. The specific elements you would typically need are form, label, input, and button. I've provided a template in the code, but you will need to tailor it for each challenge as appropriate. Make sure you link to an <strong>externally placed</strong> JavaScript file and validate your HTML to receive full credit.</p>
                
        <!-- FORM TEMPLATE -->
        <form>
            <label for="example">Input Label</label> <!-- The labels "for" attribute value must match an id value -->
            <input id="example" type="text"> <!-- type can be changed to many other things -->
            <button id="btn" type="submit">Submit Me!</button> <!-- The id is what you'll use for the onclick event -->
        </form>
        
        <!-- END FORM TEMPLATE -->
        
        <!-- Add reference to JS file beneath this comment. -->
